# Dashboard

The purpose of this dashboard is to present different aspects of the Steam games dataset (<https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games>) and allow for a deep dive into game industry as a whole.

+ The first page lets the user explore the data freely allowing them to get all available information regarding the chosen game in a concise format of a customizable table. Apart from the table there is a simple visualization of game's reviews.
+ The value page aims to help users in choosing the next game to play by recommending them games which score the best in terms of reviews and ratio of price and playtime. Users can additionally specify which genre they like and which platform they play on.
+ The history page lets the user analyze the history of the gaming industry when it comes to quality and prices of games. The bar chart shows the average ratio of positive reviews in a given year. By clicking one of the bars users can choose a year and the dashboard will show them a list of the best games from that year. Additionally the user can customize the style of the mean price line plot.
+ The last page instead of games focuses on their creators. It allows the user to quickly find developers and publishers which were releasing the best games from chosen genres during the chosen time period. Scatter plots let the user easily compare the developers and publishers in terms of number of released games, their reviews and number of players who played them.
